# Regression Exploration

This notebook is an exploration of **Linear Regression**, **Ridge Regression**, and **Lasso Regression**, using Python and gradient descent.  
It includes both mathematical intuition and practical implementation, along with visualizations of convergence and weight dynamics and its motivated from my ML module.

In thia notebook I have implemented Lasso regression from scratch using subgradient descent and visualized training loss and weight evolution over iterations
